This project involves time series data, and I attempted to implement diverse forecasting models for it. I conducted experiments with various models for different sections of the data to achieve results. To facilitate review, I split the code into two sections. It's noteworthy that the outcomes varied across each column and model. I documented all of my experiments in the file, although certain models did not yield accurate results.

In the initial section, I applied various models including Matrix Profile, Statmodels encompassing Error/Trend/Seasonality, Simple Moving Average, and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average models. 
Moving on to the second part, I experimented with Holt-Winters methods such as Exponential Smoothing, Autocorrelation Function, ARIMA, SARIMAX models, as well as the Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model. I conducted a comparison between the last two models in another section of the data.

Furthermore, I employed the Dickey Fuller test to assess data stationarity and utilized Granger Causality for forecasting viability.
